### Map (40×40 tiles, 32px each)

**Ground layer** — 5 tile types: grass, dark grass, dirt path, water, stone.
Main dirt crossroads at row 19–20 (east-west) and col 19–20 (north-south) with connecting paths to all buildings.

**Buildings** (from PRD section 3.3):
| ID | Name | Position | Size | Entry |
|----|------|----------|------|-------|
| 1 | The Enchanted Hearth (Inn) | (2,14) | 3×3 | (3,17) |
| 2 | Moonpetal Apothecary | (12,14) | 3×3 | (13,17) |
| 3 | The Gilded Quill (Library) | (8,2) | 3×3 | (9,5) |
| 4 | Starfall Plaza | (17,17) | 6×6 | (20,20) |
| 5 | Eldergrove Park | (27,2) | 5×5 | (29,7) |
| 6 | Hearthstone Bakery | (2,7) | 3×3 | (3,10) |
| 7 | The Wanderer's Workshop | (12,7) | 3×3 | (13,10) |
| 8–12 | Duskhollow Cottages (×5) | bottom-right | 2×2 each | south face |

Plaza and Park are open areas (walkable). All other buildings have collision on their footprint with a walkable entry tile.

**Objects** — trees (edges + scattered), fences, benches, flowers, lampposts, fountain. Trees, fences, lampposts, and fountain block movement. Flowers are walkable.

**Collision** — map edges, water, building footprints (except plaza/park), trees, lampposts, fences, fountain.

### Rendering Pipeline

1. **Ground cache**: Pre-rendered once to an offscreen canvas (static layer).
2. **Y-sorted drawables**: Objects, buildings, and player collected into an array, sorted by Y coordinate, then drawn in order for correct depth.
3. **Labels**: Plaza and Park names rendered as floating text labels.
4. **60fps render loop** via `requestAnimationFrame`.

### Player

- Starts at tile (20, 20) — center of Starfall Plaza.
- WASD / Arrow keys move one tile per press; holding repeats at ~150ms intervals.
- Smooth interpolation between tiles at 6 tiles/sec.
- Direction-dependent sprite: eyes face movement direction, back-of-head when facing up.
- Walk animation: 4-frame cycle at 8fps with leg movement and body bounce.

### Sprite System

All sprites are drawn procedurally (no image assets yet) using colored rectangles in a Stardew Valley-inspired palette. Each building has a unique color scheme (wall, roof, accent). Characters have skin, hair, shirt, and pants layers.

### Responsive Scaling

Canvas scales down to fit viewport while maintaining pixel-perfect rendering (`image-rendering: pixelated`).

.env.local.example                # Template for OPENAI_API_KEY and Supabase env vars
```

### Database schema

All tables defined in `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`:

- **agents** — identity, traits, position, status (mutable state)
- **memories** — append-only stream with `vector(1536)` embedding column, `ivfflat` index for cosine similarity
- **goals** — JSONB steps, status enum, priority
- **relationships** — composite PK `(agent_id, target_id)`, no FK on target so it can point at the player
- **simulation_state** — singleton row for tick/day/time
- **saved_states** — JSONB snapshots for save/load (Chunk 8)

pgvector extension enabled via `CREATE EXTENSION vector`. No RLS, no Supabase Auth (per PRD).

### LLM layer (`lib/openai.ts`)

Model constants — env-overridable but default to the PRD contract:
- `MODEL_HIGH = "gpt-4-turbo"` (decisions, conversations, reflections, goals, backstories)
- `MODEL_LOW = "gpt-4o-mini"` (importance scoring, summarization)
- `MODEL_EMBED = "text-embedding-3-small"`

`callJSON()` wraps every LLM call with:
- `response_format: { type: "json_object" }`
- Zod schema validation — invalid JSON or schema failure **throws**. Caller handles the failure (skip tick, return error, retry). No auto-repair.

Zod schemas for all four GPT output contracts from the PRD (`ActionDecision`, `ConversationTurn`, `Reflection`, `ImportanceScores`) plus `Backstory` for Chunk 2.

### /api/world/init

1. Guards against overwriting an existing world (returns 409 if agents already exist).
2. Generates all 12 backstories in parallel with `Promise.allSettled`.
3. **Any failure aborts the whole init** — never writes partial world state.
4. Inserts all 12 rows at once, then creates the singleton `simulation_state` row.
5. `maxDuration = 60` — targets Vercel Pro.

### /api/simulation/state

Returns the public-safe subset of agent fields (no backstory) plus current sim state. Polled by the canvas on mount.

### Canvas updates

- Fetches state on mount. If Supabase is unreachable or the schema is missing, surfaces a small non-blocking amber warning ("Supabase not configured") — map still renders, player still moves.
- Agents render as colored character sprites at their DB positions, with name labels (dark pill, white text) above each sprite.
- Agents inside a building (`current_building != null`) are hidden (their sprite will reappear on exit).
- When `agentCount === 0`, an **Initialize World** button appears in the header.

### Setup required (one-time)

1. Create Supabase project → copy URL + anon + service role keys into `.env.local` (use `.env.local.example` as template).
2. Run `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor.
3. Get an `OPENAI_API_KEY` from platform.openai.com.
4. Reload the app → click **Initialize World**.

## Chunk 3: Agent Movement & Pathfinding

### New files

```
src/
├── app/api/simulation/
│   ├── tick/route.ts         # POST — advance all agents one step, returns updated world
│   └── pause/route.ts        # POST — toggle is_paused in simulation_state
├── engine/
│   ├── pathfinding.ts        # A* on 4-connected tile grid (closure-based blocked fn)
│   └── buildings.ts          # Numeric bldg ID ↔ string key mapping, enterable set
supabase/migrations/
└── 002_agent_movement.sql    # Adds path (JSONB), next_decision_tick (INTEGER) to agents
```

### A* pathfinding (`engine/pathfinding.ts`)

`findPath(start, goal, width, height, blocked)` returns the list of tile steps from start (exclusive) to goal (inclusive), or `null` if unreachable.

- 4-connected grid (no diagonal movement)
- `blocked(x, y)` closure lets callers mix static collision with dynamic occupancy
- Max 2000 nodes expanded before giving up (prevents infinite loops on pathological maps)
- Returns `[]` if start === goal

### /api/simulation/tick — tick loop

Chunk 3 is pure movement, no LLM calls.

**Per-tick pipeline (server-side):**

1. Fetch `simulation_state` + all agents from Supabase.
2. If `is_paused`, return current state unchanged.
3. Increment `current_tick`. Advance `time_of_day` / `current_day` (96 ticks/day: morning < 20, midday < 48, afternoon < 64, evening < 80, night ≤ 96).
4. Build occupancy map `"x,y" → agentId` for all visible (non-indoor) agents.
5. For each agent:
   - **Skip** if `current_tick < next_decision_tick` (busy: inside a building, brief idle).
   - **Exit building**: if `current_building != null` and wait is over → clear `current_building`, `next_decision_tick = tick + 1–3`.
   - **Walk**: if `path` has tiles → attempt to advance to `path[0]`. If another agent holds that tile, wait. On arrival at path end, 50% chance to enter an enterable building (set `current_building`, `next_decision_tick = tick + 4–12`).
   - **Plan**: if no path → pick up to 8 random walkable destinations, run A* avoiding static collision + current occupancy. Store path.
6. Batch-update changed agents in parallel (`Promise.all`).
7. Update `simulation_state` tick/day/time. Return fresh agent list.

**Collision avoidance**: occupancy map prevents two agents landing on the same tile in the same tick. First-processed agent wins; others wait.

**Building enter/exit**: entry tiles are walkable in the static grid. When an agent steps onto an entry tile that belongs to an enterable building (not plaza/park), there's a 50% chance they "enter" — sprite disappears, `current_building` is set, `next_decision_tick` holds them for 4–12 ticks. On exit, they reappear at the same entry tile.

### /api/simulation/pause

`POST { paused: boolean }` — toggles `simulation_state.is_paused`. Frontend applies optimistically.

### Canvas updates

- **Play/Pause button** in the header. Paused by default (user must press Play).
- **Speed selector** (1x / 2x / 5x / 10x) → `1000 / 500 / 200 / 100 ms` between ticks.
- **Tick counter + day + time-of-day** shown in header bar.
- **Tick polling**: `setInterval` fires `POST /api/simulation/tick` at the selected speed while unpaused and agents exist. First tick fires immediately on play.
- **Agent interpolation**: each agent has `prevX/prevY` (position when tick arrived) and `current_x/current_y` (new target). Visual position is linearly interpolated over one tick interval: `t = (now - tickArrivedAt) / tickIntervalMs`, clamped to [0, 1]. Movement direction derived from the delta.
- Agents inside a building are hidden (sprite not drawn, name label not drawn).

## Chunk 4: Memory System & AI Decision-Making

### New / changed files

```
src/
├── app/api/simulation/tick/route.ts   # Full rewrite — LLM decision pipeline
├── lib/openai.ts                      # ActionDecisionSchema updated, InternalThoughtSchema added
supabase/migrations/
└── 003_memory_retrieval.sql           # match_memories(embedding, agent_id, n) RPC function
```

### Migration 003 — `match_memories` RPC

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION match_memories(
  query_embedding vector(1536), p_agent_id UUID, match_count INT)
RETURNS TABLE (id UUID, sim_tick INT, type TEXT, content TEXT, importance REAL, relevance FLOAT)
```

Returns the nearest memories by cosine similarity. Server re-ranks by:
`score = 0.3 × recency(0.995^Δtick) + 0.3 × relevance + 0.4 × importance`

### Tick pipeline (Chunk 4 — AI-driven)

**Per-tick phases (for agents who need a new decision):**

1. **Classify agents**: walking (advance path), exiting building, night-go-home override, or needing a full AI decision cycle.
2. **Build observations** (pure JS): `"[Day N, morning, tick T] I am near The Gilded Quill. Nearby: Seren Vale, Kael Mornshade."`
3. **Embed** all observations in parallel (`text-embedding-3-small`) — `Promise.allSettled`.
4. **Retrieve memories + importance scoring** in parallel:
   - `match_memories` RPC → top 30 by cosine similarity, re-ranked to top 10 by recency+relevance+importance.
   - Batch importance scoring of all new observations: one `gpt-4o-mini` call returns a score per observation.
5. **Action decisions** (`gpt-4-turbo`, parallel, `allSettled`): receives backstory + traits + observation + top-10 memories → returns `{ chosen_action, target_building, reasoning }`.
6. **Internal thoughts** (25% chance when idle): `gpt-4o-mini` generates a first-person thought stored as `internal_thought` memory.
7. **Store memories** (observations + thoughts) with embeddings in Supabase.
8. **Execute actions**: walk agents advance a tile, AI-decided agents get A* paths set, idle agents get `next_decision_tick` deferred.
9. **Update `simulation_state`**.

**Night override**: when `time_of_day === "night"`, agents not at home skip the LLM entirely and get a direct `go_home` A* path computed server-side.

**Graceful degradation**: if any LLM call fails (`allSettled`), that agent falls back to random A* wander. Importance scoring failure defaults all scores to 0.3.

### Day/night visual overlay

In the `requestAnimationFrame` loop, after drawing all sprites, a semi-transparent dark blue rectangle is composited over the canvas:

| Time of day | Alpha |
|-------------|-------|
| morning / midday | 0 |
| afternoon | 0.08 |
| evening | 0.28 |
| night | 0.52 |

At evening/night, warm radial gradients are drawn from each building (window glow effect).

### Setup required (one-time for Chunk 4)

1. Run `supabase/migrations/003_memory_retrieval.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor.
2. Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is in `.env.local`.
3. Without OpenAI configured, agents degrade to Chunk 3 random wander (no crash).

## Chunk 5: Conversations & Relationships

### New / changed files

```
src/
├── engine/conversation.ts                      # Turn pipeline, sentiment, memory summaries
├── app/api/agent/[id]/conversations/route.ts   # GET — last 20 conversations for an agent
├── app/api/simulation/tick/route.ts            # + conversation detection & pipeline
├── lib/openai.ts                               # + talk_to in ActionDecisionSchema,

supabase/migrations/
└── 004_conversations.sql                       # conversations table + indexes
```

### Conversation engine (`engine/conversation.ts`)

`runConversation(agentA, agentB, relAtoB, relBtoA, memsA, memsB, location)` drives a 2–4 turn GPT-4-turbo dialogue and returns:

- `turns[]` — `{ speaker, speakerId, line, thought }` per turn
- `memoryA/B` — conversation summary string stored in each agent's memory stream
- `sentimentDeltaA/B` — how each agent's feeling toward the other shifted (GPT-4o-mini rated, ±0.3 max per conversation)
- `relationshipNote` — one-line summary for the relationship record
- `importance[2]` — memory importance scores (GPT-4o-mini batched)

Turn structure: A opens → B responds → A continues (if `end_conversation: false`) → B closes. LLM decides to end early via the `end_conversation` boolean in `ConversationTurnSchema`.

### Tick pipeline additions (Chunk 5)

After action decisions:

1. Agents who chose `talk_to` with a reachable target (within 3 tiles, not inside a building) are paired.
2. Each pair fetches their relationship record and last 3 conversation memories from Supabase.
3. All conversation pairs run in parallel (`Promise.allSettled`).
4. On success: conversation stored in `conversations` table, memory summaries inserted with embeddings TBD (Chunk 4 embeds them on next decision cycle), relationship upserted (`familiarity += 0.05`, `sentiment += delta`). Every 5 interactions, `relationship.summary` is updated with the latest `relationshipNote`.

### Relationships table updates

- `familiarity` grows by 0.05 per conversation (capped at 1.0).
- `sentiment` shifts by GPT-4o-mini rated delta (−0.3 to +0.3 per conversation).
- `interaction_count` increments each conversation.
- `summary` regenerated every 5 interactions.

### Frontend: speech bubbles

After each tick, if conversations occurred, the last spoken line for each participant is pushed into `speechBubblesRef`. In the `requestAnimationFrame` loop:
- Bubbles expire after 6 seconds.
- Fade out in the last 1.5 seconds (`globalAlpha` ramp).
- Rendered as rounded-rect text boxes with a tail pointing down to the agent, positioned above the name label.
- Text is word-wrapped at ~28 characters per line.

### Frontend: conversation log panel

A collapsible panel below the canvas shows the last 20 conversations from the current session (stored in React state, not persisted on reload). Each entry shows tick number, agent names, and all dialogue turns color-coded by speaker.

### Setup required (one-time for Chunk 5)

Run `supabase/migrations/004_conversations.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor.
